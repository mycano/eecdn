# Description
This repository contains some code of paper 'EECDN: Energy-Efficient Cooperative DNN Edge Inference in Wireless Sensor Networks', with Long Chen, Mianyang Yao, Yalan Wu and Jigang Wu.
Then, this repository contains some folders as follows,
* `motivation`: This folder is used for motivation, to measure the energy consumption of different computing modes, i.e., non-offloading mode, full edge offloading by direct transmission mode.
* `pred`: This folder is used for network prediction.
* `NS3-code`: This folder contains the NS3 code. This code needs to be run with the input of information, i.e., transmission power, location, the offloading method.
* `algo`: This folder contains all the algorithms that are used for experiments.
